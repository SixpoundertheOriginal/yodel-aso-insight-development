# Metadata KPI Guide
## Understanding Your ASO Audit Metrics

**Last Updated**: November 25, 2025
**Purpose**: User-friendly explanations of all metadata audit KPIs and how to improve them.

---

## 📊 Overview

The ASO Audit analyzes your app's metadata (title, subtitle, description) across **7 core dimensions**. Each dimension is scored 0-100, and the system identifies optimization opportunities by calculating the "gap to 100" for each metric.

**All metrics come from the ASO Bible Engine ("The Brain")** - a deterministic, rule-based system that evaluates your metadata against best practices for your vertical and market.

## 🎯 Core Metadata Dimensions

### 1. Intent Coverage (0-100)

**What it measures**: How well your metadata addresses different types of user search queries.

**Why it matters**: Users search with different intents at different stages:
- **Informational** (learning/discovery): "how to learn spanish", "language learning tips"
- **Commercial** (comparison): "best language app", "duolingo vs rosetta stone"
- **Transactional** (ready to buy): "download spanish app", "free language learning"

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Your metadata speaks to users at all stages of the decision journey
- **50-79 (Good)**: You cover some intents but miss opportunities in other stages
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: You're too narrow - only attracting one type of searcher

**What a -55 gap means**:
Your current score is 45/100. You have a **critical 55-point gap**, indicating you're missing major search intent categories. For example, you might be heavy on transactional keywords ("download now", "free") but light on informational keywords ("learn", "tutorial") that attract discovery traffic.

**How to improve**:
1. Add informational keywords: learn, guide, tutorial, how to, tips
2. Include commercial keywords: best, vs, compare, top, review
3. Use transactional keywords: free, download, get, start, try
4. Balance all three types - don't over-index on any one intent

**Example**:
```
❌ Bad (single intent): "Download Best Spanish App Free - Learn Now"
✅ Good (multi-intent): "Learn Spanish: Lessons, Courses & Practice - Compare Methods"
```

### 2. Keyword Coverage (0-100)

**What it measures**: Percentage of high-value keywords from your category that you've included in your metadata.

**Why it matters**: The ASO Bible identifies must-have keywords for your vertical by analyzing top performers. Higher coverage = better discoverability.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: You've covered most critical keywords - strong discoverability
- **50-79 (Good)**: Covering some keywords but missing opportunities
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Missing many high-value keywords - hard to discover

**What a -35 gap means**:
Your current score is 65/100. You have a **significant 35-point gap**, meaning you're missing about 1/3 of the high-value keywords in your category. Competitors with better coverage will outrank you for those missing terms.

**How to improve**:
1. Research top apps in your category - what keywords do they use?
2. Prioritize high-traffic, low-competition keywords
3. Include category-defining terms (e.g., "meditation app" for wellness)
4. Add long-tail variations (e.g., "guided meditation for sleep")
5. Avoid keyword stuffing - focus on natural integration

**Example**:
```
❌ Missing keywords: "meditation" → 65/100
✅ Added keywords: "meditation, mindfulness, sleep, stress relief, guided" → 95/100
```

---

### 3. Combo Quality (0-100)

**What it measures**: Quality and searchability of 2-3 word phrases formed by your metadata.

**Why it matters**: Users rarely search single keywords. They search phrases like "learn spanish kids" or "free yoga classes". High combo quality means your metadata forms real, searchable phrases.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Generates many high-quality, intent-rich combos
- **50-79 (Good)**: Some good combos, many generic ones
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Mostly generic or nonsensical combos

**What a -40 gap means**:
Your current score is 60/100. You have a **critical 40-point gap**, indicating your metadata produces many low-value combos like "best top app" instead of specific phrases like "spanish lessons kids".

**How to improve**:
1. Write metadata that naturally forms phrases (not keyword lists)
2. Test combinations - would users search for "top best great app"? No!
3. Avoid filler words: best, top, great, new, amazing
4. Create specific combos: "kids spanish lessons" not "best app kids"
5. Balance branded combos with discovery combos

**Example**:
```
❌ Low combo quality: "Best Top Language Learning App - Great Lessons"
   → Generates: "best top", "top language", "great lessons" (generic)

✅ High combo quality: "Spanish Lessons for Kids - Interactive Learning Games"
   → Generates: "spanish lessons", "lessons kids", "interactive learning" (specific!)
```

### 4. Discovery Coverage (0-100)

**What it measures**: Percentage of your metadata optimized for organic discovery (non-branded searches).

**Why it matters**: If your metadata is brand-heavy, only users who already know your app can find you. Discovery coverage measures how much you're optimized for new user acquisition.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Well-balanced between brand and discovery
- **50-79 (Good)**: Some discovery keywords, but could expand
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Over-branded - limiting growth potential

**What a -45 gap means**:
Your current score is 55/100. You have a **critical 45-point gap**, indicating you're over-indexing on brand terms (repeating your app name too many times) at the expense of generic discovery keywords.

**How to improve**:
1. Limit brand mentions to 1-2 times (title OR subtitle, not both repeatedly)
2. Add category keywords: "meditation app" not just "Calm"
3. Include use-case keywords: "sleep better", "reduce stress"
4. Target competitor keywords where appropriate
5. Focus subtitle/description on discovery, not brand reinforcement

**Example**:
```
❌ Over-branded (low discovery): "Duolingo - Duolingo Language Learning by Duolingo"
   → Brand ratio: 75% (too high!)

✅ Balanced discovery: "Duolingo: Learn Spanish, French & More - Language Lessons"
   → Brand ratio: 20% (optimal!)
```

### 5. Relevance (0-100)

**What it measures**: How closely your keywords align with your app category and user needs.

**Why it matters**: Irrelevant keywords attract the wrong users (low conversion) or waste space on generic terms. The ASO Bible scores tokens 0-3 based on category relevance.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Highly relevant, category-specific keywords
- **50-79 (Good)**: Mostly relevant, some generic filler
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Many low-relevance or off-category keywords

**What a -30 gap means**:
Your current score is 70/100. You have a **significant 30-point gap**, indicating you're using too many generic modifiers ("best", "top") or off-category terms instead of vertical-specific language.

**How to improve**:
1. Remove generic modifiers: "best", "top", "new", "great" (relevance = 0)
2. Add category jargon: For language apps, use "fluency", "pronunciation", "immersion"
3. Include problem-solution keywords: What pain points do you solve?
4. Avoid trendy but irrelevant keywords
5. Test against user persona - would they search for this?

**Example**:
```
❌ Low relevance: "Best New Top Language App - Great Learning"
   → Tokens: "best"(0), "new"(0), "top"(0), "great"(0) → Score: 40/100

✅ High relevance: "Spanish Fluency: Grammar, Vocabulary & Pronunciation Practice"
   → Tokens: "fluency"(3), "grammar"(2), "vocabulary"(2), "pronunciation"(3) → Score: 95/100
```

### 6. Structure (0-100)

**What it measures**: Optimal use of character limits, readability, and organization.

**Why it matters**: Well-structured metadata is easier for users to scan and for algorithms to parse. Poor structure wastes precious character space.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Full use of space, readable, well-organized
- **50-79 (Good)**: Adequate but leaving space unused or hard to read
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Too short, too long, or disorganized

**Character limits**:
- **iOS**: 30-char title, 30-char subtitle
- **Android**: 50-char title, 80-char subtitle

**How to improve**:
1. Use 80-95% of character limits (don't waste space!)
2. Keep title to 3-5 words for readability
3. Keep subtitle to 4-6 words for coverage without crowding
4. Structure descriptions with sections: features, benefits, use cases
5. Use bullet points or line breaks for easy scanning
6. Avoid all-caps, emoji spam, or excessive punctuation

**Example**:
```
❌ Poor structure: "App" (3/30 chars = 10% utilization)
✅ Good structure: "Spanish Lessons - Learn Fast" (28/30 chars = 93% utilization)
```

### 7. Brand Balance (0-100)

**What it measures**: Optimal ratio of branded vs. generic keywords (target: 10-25% branded).

**Why it matters**: Too little brand = no identity. Too much brand = limited discovery. You need the sweet spot.

**Score interpretation**:
- **80-100 (Excellent)**: Perfect balance (10-25% branded)
- **50-79 (Good)**: Slightly off - either over or under-branded
- **0-49 (Needs Work)**: Serious imbalance

**What a -35 gap means**:
Your current score is 65/100. You have a **significant 35-point gap**, indicating you're either:
- **Over-branded** (>40% brand terms): Limiting discovery
- **Under-branded** (<5% brand terms): Losing identity

**How to improve**:
1. Aim for 10-25% brand ratio (1-2 mentions in title/subtitle combined)
2. If over-branded: Remove repetitive mentions, add features instead
3. If under-branded: Add brand name once for recognition
4. Use brand strategically: "Duolingo Spanish" not "Duolingo by Duolingo"
5. Save brand-heavy content for screenshots/videos

**Example**:
```
❌ Over-branded (60% ratio): "Headspace Meditation by Headspace - Headspace Sleep"
❌ Under-branded (0% ratio): "Meditation, Sleep & Mindfulness - Stress Relief"
✅ Balanced (15% ratio): "Headspace: Meditation & Sleep - Guided Mindfulness"
```

## 📈 Understanding Gaps (Delta to 100)

The "Optimization Opportunities" chart shows the **gap to 100** for each dimension. This represents your improvement potential.

### Gap Severity Levels:

| Gap Size | Severity | What It Means | Priority |
|----------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **40+** | Critical | High-impact opportunity - address immediately | 🔴 Urgent |
| **25-39** | Significant | Strong opportunity - prioritize in next update | 🟡 High |
| **15-24** | Moderate | Worth addressing - moderate impact | 🟢 Medium |
| **0-14** | Minor | Small refinement - already strong | ⚪ Low |

### Examples:

```
Intent Coverage: 45/100 → Gap: -55 (Critical)
└─ This is your BIGGEST opportunity. Focus here first.

Keyword Coverage: 78/100 → Gap: -22 (Moderate)
└─ Already pretty good. Fine-tune when you have time.

Structure: 92/100 → Gap: -8 (Minor)
└─ Excellent! Just minor polish needed.
```
