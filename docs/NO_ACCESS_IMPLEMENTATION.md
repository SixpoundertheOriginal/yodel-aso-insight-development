# No Access Screen Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive No Access screen for users who are authenticated but lack proper organization assignment or role-based permissions in the SaaS application.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **`src/pages/no-access.tsx`** - Main No Access page component
2. **`src/hooks/useAccessControl.ts`** - Custom hook for access control logic
3. **`src/components/Auth/AppAuthGuard.tsx`** - High-level auth guard (optional)
4. **`src/lib/analytics/accessDeniedEvent.ts`** - Centralized access denied logging
5. **`src/components/Auth/AccessControlTest.tsx`** - Development testing component

### Modified Files
1. **`src/components/Auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`** - Enhanced with NoAccess integration
2. **`src/App.tsx`** - Added route for NoAccess page

## Implementation Details

### 1. NoAccess Page Features
- **Enterprise-friendly UI** with branded styling matching sign-in page
- **Clear messaging** without technical details
- **Contact support** functionality with mailto link
- **Sign out button** with proper Supabase auth integration
- **Development debug info** (only shown in development)
- **Centralized logging** for troubleshooting

### 2. Access Control Logic

The `useAccessControl` hook determines user access based on:

```typescript
// Access is denied if:
- User is authenticated BUT
- User has no organization (organizationId === null) AND is not super admin
- OR user has no roles (roles.length === 0) AND is not super admin
```

**Super admins always have access** even without organization assignment.

### 3. Security Features

#### Client-Side Protection
- **Route guards** in `ProtectedRoute` component
- **Real-time access checking** based on auth state changes
- **Auth flow detection** to avoid blocking legitimate auth processes

#### Server-Side Protection
- Edge Functions already require proper JWT tokens
- RLS policies enforce organization-level data isolation
- Admin operations require service role permissions

### 4. Logging & Analytics

Comprehensive event logging includes:

```typescript
interface AccessDeniedEventData {
  userId: string;
  email?: string;
  organizationId: string | null;
  roles: string[];
  isSuperAdmin: boolean;
  reason: 'no-organization' | 'no-roles' | 'other';
  timestamp: string;
  userAgent?: string;
  path?: string;
}
```

**Logging destinations:**
- Console (always)
- Google Analytics (if configured)
- Custom analytics services (extensible)
- LocalStorage (for support debugging)

### 5. User Experience Flow

```
User logs in successfully
↓
Has organization?  → NO → Show NoAccess screen
↓ YES
Has valid roles?   → NO → Show NoAccess screen  
↓ YES
Continue to app
```

**Auth flow exceptions:**
- OAuth callbacks
- Email confirmation flows
- Password reset flows
- Users in `/auth/*` routes

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test No Organization Access:**
   ```sql
   -- In database, temporarily set user's organization_id to NULL
   UPDATE profiles SET organization_id = NULL WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
   ```

2. **Test No Roles Access:**
   ```sql
   -- Remove all user roles
   DELETE FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
   ```

3. **Test Super Admin Override:**
   ```sql
   -- Super admins should always have access
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, organization_id) 
   VALUES ('user-uuid', 'SUPER_ADMIN', NULL);
   ```

### Development Testing Component

Include `<AccessControlTest />` in your app during development to monitor access control state in real-time.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Optional: Enable navigation permissions (additional security layer)
VITE_NAV_PERMISSIONS_ENABLED=true

# Analytics configuration
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID
```

### Customization Points

1. **Support Contact:**
   ```typescript
   // In src/pages/no-access.tsx, modify:
   const handleContactSupport = () => {
     window.location.href = 'mailto:your-support@company.com';
   };
   ```

2. **Analytics Integration:**
   ```typescript
   // In src/lib/analytics/accessDeniedEvent.ts
   // Add your analytics service in sendToCustomAnalytics()
   ```

3. **Styling:**
   - Uses existing design system (Card, Button components)
   - Matches sign-in page branding
   - Fully responsive design

## Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Secure
- JWT token validation on all protected routes
- RLS policies prevent data leakage
- Server-side Edge Function permissions
- No sensitive data exposed in NoAccess UI
- Proper auth state management

### ⚠️ Security Notes
- NoAccess is client-side only (UI layer)
- API calls still require proper authentication
- Edge Functions validate permissions server-side
- RLS policies provide database-level security

## Monitoring & Alerts

Consider setting up alerts for:

```javascript
// Example alert conditions
- High volume of access denied events
- Users repeatedly hitting NoAccess screen
- Specific patterns in denial reasons
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User sees NoAccess incorrectly:**
   - Check organization assignment in database
   - Verify user roles are properly set
   - Check RLS policies aren't blocking org lookup

2. **Super admin sees NoAccess:**
   - Verify `is_super_admin()` RPC function works
   - Check `user_roles` table for SUPER_ADMIN role
   - Ensure `organization_id = NULL` for super admin role

3. **Analytics not logging:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify gtag is loaded (if using GA)
   - Check localStorage for `access_denied_events`

### Debug Information

In development, check:
- Browser localStorage: `access_denied_events`
- Console logs: Search for "ACCESS DENIED"
- Network tab: Verify API calls are working
- Database: Check `profiles` and `user_roles` tables

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- **Email notifications** to admins when users hit NoAccess
- **Self-service organization requests** (with approval workflow)
- **Temporary access grants** for emergency situations
- **Integration with ticketing systems** for access requests
- **A/B testing** different NoAccess messaging

## Summary

This implementation provides enterprise-grade access control with:
- ✅ Secure, user-friendly NoAccess screen
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and analytics
- ✅ Proper handling of auth flows
- ✅ Super admin exceptions
- ✅ Development testing tools
